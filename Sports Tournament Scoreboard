Sports Tournament Scoreboard

A school organizes an inter-school football tournament.
They maintain a 2D array where:

Each row represents a team.
Each column represents a match played.
The value stored is the number of goals scored in that match.


 Problem Statement

Using the 2D array:

1. Find if any team remained unbeaten (i.e., scored more goals than the opponent in all their matches).

   Assume if team A’s goals in column j > team B’s goals in the same column, then A won that match.
2. Check if there exists any match where all teams scored the same number of goals.
3. Find the team with the highest single-match score (not total, but max in any one match).
4. Identify teams that never scored more than 2 goals in any match.



 Example

Input (4 teams × 3 matches):


2 1 3
3 2 1
1 1 1
4 0 2


Output:

Unbeaten Team: None

Match with equal goals: Match 2 (all scored 1,2,1,0 → No) → None

Highest single-match score: Team 4 with 4 goals

Teams that never scored more than 2 goals: Team 3


Example 2:

3 2 4
1 1 2
0 2 1


Unbeaten Team: Team 1
Match with equal goals: None
Highest single-match score: Team 1 with 4 goals
Teams that never scored more than 2 goals: Team 2, Team 3
