Survey Data – Majority Opinion Finder

A company runs a customer surveyacross multiple cities.
They store responses in a 2D array:

Each row→ a city.
Each column→ a person’s response in that city.
Values:

  1 → “Yes”
  0 → “No”



 Problem Statement

Given the survey data:

1. Determine the majority opinion in each city(Yes or No).
2. Find if there exists any city with a tie(equal Yes and No).
3. Find the city with the strongest agreement(highest difference between Yes and No counts).
4. Check if the majority opinion is consistent across all cities(i.e., all “Yes” or all “No”).



 Example

Input (3 cities × 6 people):


1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0


Output:


City-wise Majority:
City 1 → Yes (4 vs 2)
City 2 → No (4 vs 2)
City 3 → Yes (5 vs 1)

City with a tie: None

Strongest agreement: City 3 (difference = 4)

Majority consistent across all cities: No
