Student Marks Analysis

A school stores students’ marks in different subjects using a 2D array:

Each row represents a student.
Each column represents a subject.

You are asked to help the school with data analysis

Problem Statement

Given a `N x M` 2D array of marks:

1. Calculate each student’s total marks and display them.
2. Find the topper student (the one with the highest total marks).
3. Calculate subject-wise averages (average marks for each column).
4. Find the student who scored the lowest in Mathematics (say column `0`).

Example
Input (4 students × 3 subjects):
70 80 90
85 60 75
40 95 65
88 76 90
Output:
Student totals:
Student 1 → 240
Student 2 → 220
Student 3 → 200
Student 4 → 254

Topper: Student 4 (254 marks)

Subject-wise averages:
Subject 1 → 70.75
Subject 2 → 77.75
Subject 3 → 80.00

Lowest in Mathematics: Student 3 (40 marks)
