Hospital Patient Data Tracking

A hospital keeps track of patients admitted in different wards using a 2D array:

Each row*represents a ward.
Each column*represents a day of the week (7 days).
The value stored is the number of patients admitted that day.

Given an `N x 7` 2D array:

1. Calculate the total number of patients per ward*(row-wise sum).
2. Find the busiest day of the hospital*(column with maximum total admissions).
3. Find the ward with the minimum total patients.
4. Find the average admissions per day across the entire hospital.
Input (3 wards × 7 days):
5  8  6  7  9  4  3
10 12 8  6  7  5  4
2  3  5  4  6  7  8
Output:
Total patients per ward:
Ward 1 → 42
Ward 2 → 52
Ward 3 → 35

Busiest Day: Day 2 (23 patients total)

Ward with minimum patients: Ward 3 (35 patients)

Average admissions per day (entire hospital): 12.61
